what is class?

>>Interface only declears method and variables without any definition and the classes which
 will be use those should implement those methods .On the other side abstract class must have at
 least one abstract  method which will defined in the child class. it can also have non abstract method
 but we can not create an instance of an abstract class.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?

>>>No , we can't . But we can implement interface and extend abstract class and then create new concrete class.
we can create objects of the concrete class.
what is Access Specifier?
>>Acccess specifier determines which variables or methods or class can be accesed by which user.
What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
>>.OOP is object oreinted programming. The features opf oop is
1. Abstraction: implementation Hiding
2.Encapsulation: use of access modifier
3. inheritance: Using parent class and child class
4. polymorphishm: use of overloading and overrideing

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
>>Application programming interface .JDK is an API.
Does java support multiple inheritance?
>>no
What is method overloading and when it happens?
>>When we have same method name and two different parameters then we have to use overload
What is method overriding and when it happens?
>>If we want to modify a method of parent class we use overriding we can redefine the method in child
class
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
>> An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program,

Static in terms of variable: We can assign static variable without creating an object
Static in terms of methods: We can use the static method of a class without creating an object of that
class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
>>Final makes the variable constant means that its value cannot be changed later.
And final methods mean those methods cant be overidden

What is final, finally and finalize?

What is compile time and run time?
>>Compile time: the time period in which the developer compiles code
Runtime: the time period which a user is running one piece of software;
What is heap?
>>Heap is part of memory management system where instance of classes is saved

How java manage it's memory?
>>Java object resides in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts usp and may
increaswe or decrease in size while the applications runs . When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected
by java gabage collector.During this process, objects that are no longer used are cleared , thus
makes new space for new objects

>>String is prototype of text
Stringbuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object.The object created through
StringBuilder is stored the heap.String Buffer has the same methods as the StringBuilder. but each
method in stringbuffer is synchronized that is Strign buffer is thread safe.

strintbuilder: String builder is same as the StringBuffer, that is it stores the object in heap and
it can also be modified. The main difference between the StringBuffer and stringBuilder is the String
builder is also not thread safe.
