Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
>>To keep any record organize to retrive and access it

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
>> compiler design
  Operating System.
  Database Management System.
  Statistical analysis package
  Numerical Analysis

what is an Array?
>> Array is a kind of data structure which can save kind of data type of fixed amount  elements

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
>>Array is fixed size and can store same kind of primitiove type(int ,long) and arraylist is resizable and we store
reference type

what is LinkedList?
>>Linked list connects two elements using nodes
what is queue?
>>Queue is fifo. It can retrive the information that is inserted first
what is stack?
>>Stack is LIFO. It can retrive the info that is inserted later
what is FIFO and LIFO?
>>Fifo--First In First Out
LIFO--- Last In Last Out
what is the order of complexity?
>>> order of complexity is how an algorithm change in terms of changing input size ans way they behave.
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
>> o(1)
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
>>>o(n)
what is tree in data structure?
>A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes where each not is a dat structure
consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes with the constrains that no reference is duplicated
and none points to the root
what is graph in data structure?
>>> A graph is a structure consisting of a set of arrays and set of edges.An edge is a pair of vertices. The two
vertices are called the edge endpoints.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
>>Hashmap is non synchronized and not thread safe. On the other hand, Hashtable is thread safe and synchronized.
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
>>>RDBMS: Array
Network Data Model: Graph
Hierarchical data model: trees
How HashMap works in java?
>>>Hashmap in java work on hashing principle. It is a data structure which allows us to store object and retrieve it in constant
time 0(1) provided we know the key.
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
>>It is a exception that is thrown  to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illeagal index.
The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
>>>Using for loop or cloning.
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
>>>They both are made from list interface.They have same kind of method but they are differeent in the way they save
materials
What is DFS and BFS?
>>For BFS in directed graph, each edge of the graph either connects two vertices at the same level, goes down exactly one
level,or goes up any number of levels.For DFS,
each edge either connects an ancestor to a descendant , a descendant to an ancestor,or one node to a node in previously
visited subtree

What is Recursion?
>>Recursion is a basic programming technique that we can use in Java where a method calls itself to solve some
problesm

What is Big-(O)-notation?
>>Big O notation is mathmatical notation that describes the limiting  behavior of a function when the argument tends
towards a particular value or infinity

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
>>                    best       average      worst

BubbleSort            o(N)         O(nlog(n))    o(n^2)

insetion sort          o(n)       o(n^2)          o(n^2)
selection sort         o(n^2)      o(n^2)         o(n^2)
heap sort             o(nlog(n))    o(nlog(n))     o(nlog(n))

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.


 >>>Arraylist Access faster if the index is known , Inserting is easier. Searching and removing take compartively long time
 Linked List -- slow access, adding and deletion is faster and searching is much faster then arraylist
 Map--- easier ot search if the key is known , insertion takes long time.
